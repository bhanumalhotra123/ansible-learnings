Setting Up environment

VMs using Virtual Box or VMWare Workstation
Docker
Vagrant

We need a control system where we can install ansible and target other systems.

Setting up 

virtualbox.org
Install it

osboxes.org/debian/
you will find images here
We will use Debian 8.6 Jessie image  Download it

Go to VMWare

Name: Ansible Controller
Type: Linux
Version: Debian 64 bit [the image you downloaded]
Memory size: 1Gb would be fine for now
Hard Disk: Here you select the image .vdi file

Now we have to make sure this VM have access to the internet.

Settings > Adapter > Bridged Adapter

Power it on!

pass is give from where you download the file

  
su     [switch to root]

ifconfig to get the ip

Do ssh into it using your terminal

Go to https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/installation_distros.html#installing-ansible-on-debian

after installation check using the command: ansible


Create two more such servers

We can do different things like applying playbooks on different environments
or you can have 1 for app and other for db 

Now you can create snapshots of these vms we created so that when testing of playbooks is down we can revert back.
So before running the playbook please revert back.



Add the following line to /etc/apt/sources.list or /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ansible.list:

deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ansible/ansible/ubuntu MATCHING_UBUNTU_CODENAME_HERE main
Example for Debian 11 (Bullseye)

deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ansible/ansible/ubuntu focal main

for debian12
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bookworm main


Then run these commands:

$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 93C4A3FD7BB9C367
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install ansible









Ansible Controller

Ansible Target 1
Ansible Target 2



Ansible Controller

cat > inventory.txt

target1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10 ansible_ssh_pass=Passw0rd
target2 ansible_host=192.168.1.13 ansible_ssh_pass=Passw0rd



ansible target1 -m ping  -i inventory.txt     

Failed!

Using a SSH password instead of a key is not possible because Host Key checking is enabled and 
ssh password does not support this. Please add this host's fingerprint to your known_hosts file to manage this host.

Security out of the Box
